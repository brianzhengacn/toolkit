        Instance Attributes
        ------------------------
        model_params : object of type ModelContainer
                Data holder that contains all the attributes of the model to be assessed. Compulsory input for initialization.

        fair_metric_obj : object
                Stores the FairnessMetrics() object and contains the result of the computations.

        perf_metric_obj : object
                Stores the PerformanceMetrics() object and contains the result of the computations.

        percent_distribution : dictionary, default = None
                Stores the percentage breakdown of the classes in y_true.

        calibration_score : float, default = None
                The brier score loss computed for calibration. Computable if y_prob is given.

        tradeoff_obj : object
                Stores the TradeoffRate() object and contains the result of the computations.

        correlation_output : Dataframe, default = None
                Pairwise correlation of most important features (top 20 feature + protected variables).

        feature_mask : dictionary of lists, default = None
                Stores the mask array for every protected variable applied on the x_test dataset.

        fair_conclusion : dictionary
                Contains conclusion of how the primary fairness metric compares against the fairness threshold. The key will be the protected variable and the conclusion will be "fair" or "unfair".
                e.g. {"gender": {'fairness_conclusion': "fair", "threshold": 0.01}, "race":{'fairness_conclusion': "unfair", "threshold": 0.01}}

        evaluate_status : int, default=0
                Tracks the status of the completion of the evaluate() method to be checked in compile(). Either 1 for complete or -1 for error if any exceptions were raised.

        evaluate_status_cali: boolean, default=False
                Tracks the status of the completion of the calibration curve step within evaluate() method to be checked in compile().
                False = Skipped (if y_prob is not provided)
                True = Complete

        tradeoff_status : int, default=0
                Tracks the status of the completion of the tradeoff() method to be checked in compile().
                0 = Not started
                1 = Complete
                -1 = Skipped (if y_prob is not provided)

        feature_imp_status : int, default=0
                Tracks the status of the completion of the compute_feature_imp() method to be checked in compile(). Either 1 for complete or -1 for error if any exceptions were raised.

        feature_imp_status_loo: boolean, default=False
                Tracks the status of the completion of the leave-one-out analysis step within feature_importance() method to be checked in compile().
                False = Skipped (if x_train or y_train or model object or fit/predict operator names are not provided)
                True = Complete

        feature_imp_status_corr: boolean, default=False
                Tracks the status of the completion of the correlation matrix computation step within feature_importance() method to be checked in compile().
                False = Skipped (if the correlation dataframe is not provided in ModelContainer)
                True = Complete

        feature_imp_values: dictionary of lists, default = None
                Contains the difference in metric values between the original and loco models for each protected variable.
